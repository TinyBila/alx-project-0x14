## Authentication
To access the API, you must include a valid API Key in the request headers.

Steps:

Register for a MoviesDatabase developer account.

Generate an API key from your dashboard.

Include this key in all API requests.

Important: Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
Rate Limit: 100 requests per minute (example â€” confirm from documentation).

Best Practices
Cache frequent requests to reduce API calls.

Handle rate-limit errors gracefully with exponential backoff.

Secure your API key in environment variables (.env file).

Use pagination when retrieving large datasets.
